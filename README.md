## My process

- Flexbox


### What I learned

From this project i have learned how to blend a image with de background-color using the mix-blend-mode property.

```css
        img {
            height: 100%;
            mix-blend-mode: multiply;
            opacity: 0.8;
        }
```

### Useful resources

- [Mix-blend-mode MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This helped me to understand the property mix-blend-mode to make the image color purple.
